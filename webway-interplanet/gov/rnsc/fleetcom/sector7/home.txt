"always pushing outwards"

We are the proud, the oldest organized fleet in the Royal Naval Space Command.
For 207 years, we have defended and enforced the Covenant's frontiers against all who would
seek to taint it. From Junikh to Kalisch, Franks to Communists to Custodian, we have always 
held the line.
We have always based our home ports upon the furthest reaches of Mekhain's royal Dominion.
We are the only fleet which does not depend upon the Covenant's robust logistical backbone
to complete our goals. We are a fully independent and flexible force of the most maneuverable
and long-legged vessels. Now our frontiers are threatened, and now these aliens will know the
point of our knife.
As the now-commander Rananov spoke upon the blasphemous Custodian swarms:

"Our faith is like a volley from a thousand shining guns. 
Your life extends only to the moment it reaches you."
